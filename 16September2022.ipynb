    "You are driving from Riddler City to Puzzletown, which are separated by 1,500 miles of highway. On a full charge, your electric car can drive for 500 miles before it needs a recharge. Fortunately, the highway has charging stations every 250 miles, with the first in Riddler City and the last in Puzzletown.\n",

    "Once you commit to charging your car at a station, you must wait until it is fully charged. For the purposes of this riddle, put aside anything you know about electronics and assume that the charging occurs at a constant rate. Also, assume that you can comfortably roll into a charging station just as your car runs out of power and recharge it there.\n",

    "You begin your journey with a full charge. Before heading out, you want to come up with an itinerary for which charging stations youâ€™ll stop at along the way. Being impatient, you also want to arrive in Puzzletown as quickly as possible, meaning you want to minimize the time spent waiting at charging stations.\n",

    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 7 total charging stations - one in Riddler City, one in Puzzletown, and six along the way (at 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1250 miles from Riddler City). Let's number these 0 to 6. We will always charge up fully (since we must) in Riddler City, and since the last station is in Puzzletown it doesn't matter whether we need to charge there or not. So we are really just worried about which of 1-5 we will stop at, and we'll roll into Puzzletown on an empty tank if we have to. I will now construct all possible paths, starting at 0 and eventually reaching 6."
